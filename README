All of us when working in list of files come across the problem of searching for string in the files and then if the string is found, we manually open that file and go to a specific line. 

All this can be done with a stroke of key using this script.

This script is used to find a string in files in current directory. This script copies the finding in a buffer and opens it in the same window. 

To go to a particular line/file in which the string is found. Click F2 on the top of the line in the buffer.

Procedure:
1. execute :CALL "<string>" in gvim
	This will execute windows findstr command and will open the file in the same buffer
2. Go to a line/file in the new buffer that you want to open.
3. Press F2

Result:
It will open up a file in a same window and will go to that line.

How to Execute:
1. :CALL "<string>"
	Will search for String in all the files in current dorectory
2. Press <F3>, this will search all files in directory for string on which the cursor exists
